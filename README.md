## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emily, a full-stack Software Engineer with experience in React, Next.js, and Ruby on Rails. My previous background in sociology has helped me cultivate the skills necessary for web development, including organization and writing clean code, creative problem-solving, and strong attention to detail.

Currently learning AWS to become a Certified Cloud Practitioner :cloud:

In my free time, I love hiking, yoga, and spending time with my two cats :cat:
